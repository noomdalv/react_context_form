## WebSockets Chat App

The objective of this project is to learn the fundamentals of the React Context API.  
It consists of a language selector which the user can click to switch between English and Spanish to display the user input form and submit button text in their respective languages.
The App uses a LanguageStore class component to wrap and send via this.props.children the current selected language down to the nested children components through the Context.Provider.

## Built With

- Node (JS Runtime)
- Express.js (Web Server)
- Socket.io (WebSockets library)
- HTML / CSS
