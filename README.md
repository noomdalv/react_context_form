## Context API Language Selector Form

The objective of this project is to learn the fundamentals of the React Context API.   
It consists of a language selector which the user can click to switch between English and Spanish to display the user input form and submit button text in their respective languages.  
The App uses a LanguageStore class component to wrap and send via this.props.children the current selected language down to the nested children components through the Context.Provider.

## Built With

- ReactJS
- React Context API
